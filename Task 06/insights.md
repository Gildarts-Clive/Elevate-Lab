# World Happiness Report 2019: Key Insights

## 1. Statistical Summary
-   **Distribution**: Happiness scores follow a roughly normal distribution.
-   **Range**: The happiest countries score near 8.0, while the least happy struggle below 3.0.
-   **Global Divide**: The stark contrast between the Top 10 and Bottom 10 (visible in the split bar chart) highlights massive inequality in well-being.

## 2. Factor Analysis
-   **Key Drivers**: *GDP per Capita* and *Social Support* are the strongest predictors of happiness.
-   **Health**: *Healthy life expectancy* tracks very closely with economic prosperity.
-   **Generosity**: Interestingly, *Generosity* does not correlate strongly with the overall happiness score, suggesting it is cultural or independent of national wealth.

## 3. Multivariate Profiles (Parallel Coordinates)
-   **High Tier (Happiest)**: Countries in the top tier consistently score high across *all* metrics (GDP, freedom, support), showing a "virtuous cycle" of development.
-   **Low Tier (Least Happy)**: These countries are characterized by low scores across the board, particularly in *Social Support* and *GDP*.
-   **Exceptions**: Some middle-tier countries perform exceptionally well in *Freedom* or *Generosity* despite lower GDPs, but they barely break into the top tier.

## 4. Correlations
-   The **Correlation Heatmap** confirms that:
    -   Score vs GDP: **0.79** (Very Strong)
    -   Score vs Support: **0.78** (Very Strong)
    -   Score vs Health: **0.78** (Very Strong)
    -   Score vs Generosity: **0.08** (Weak)
