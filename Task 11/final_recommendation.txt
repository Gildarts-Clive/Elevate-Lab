
A/B Test Final Recommendation Report
====================================

1. Executive Summary
--------------------
The A/B test compared the performance of a targeted ad campaign (Test Group) against a Public Service Announcement (Control Group). 
The primary goal was to determine if the ad campaign significantly increased user conversion rates.
Result: The ad campaign demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in conversion rates compared to the control group.

2. Methodology
--------------
- Groups: 
    - Control (PSA): 23524 users
    - Test (Ad): 564577 users
- Metric: Conversion Rate (Unique conversions / Total users)
- Statistical Test: Chi-Square Test & Z-Test for Proportions (Alpha = 0.05)

3. Key Findings
---------------
- Control Conversion Rate: 1.79%
- Test Conversion Rate: 2.55%
- Lift: 43.09%
  (The ad group converted 43.09% more users relative to the control group.)
- Confidence Interval (95%): The true difference in conversion rates lies between 0.60% and 0.94%.
- P-Value: 0.00000
  (Since p-value < 0.05, the results are statistically significant and not due to random chance.)

4. Additional Insights
----------------------
- Day of Week: Conversion rates varied by day. [Refer to 'Conversion Rate by Day' chart in notebook]
- Hour of Day: Peak conversion hours were identified. [Refer to 'Conversion Rate by Hour' chart in notebook]
- Ad Exposure: Users who converted typically saw the ad more often.

5. Business Recommendation
--------------------------
LAUNCH THE CAMPAIGN.
The observed lift of ~43% in conversion rate is substantial and statistically reliable. 
The ad creative and targeting strategy are effective in driving user action compared to the baseline.

6. Next Steps
-------------
- Scale the ad campaign to a broader audience.
- Consider segmenting the audience based on the 'Day of Week' and 'Hour of Day' insights to optimize ad spend during peak conversion times.
- Monitor long-term retention of converted users to ensure quality of acquisition.
