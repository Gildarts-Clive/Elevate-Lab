1. Core Genre Strategy: "Rock" is the Primary Revenue Driver
The "Rock" category is not just the most popular; it dominates the store's financial performance, accounting for over 50% of total revenue. This is significantly higher than the next closest competitors (Latin and Metal).
Recommendation: Marketing budgets should prioritize Rock music enthusiasts, and inventory expansion should focus on acquiring deep catalogs of classic rock artists rather than diversifying too broadly into niche genres.

2. Geographic Focus: The USA is the Critical Market
The United States is the undisputed leader in both customer volume and total sales revenue, often generating double the revenue of the next largest country (typically Canada or France).
Recommendation: Since the US market is the most mature and profitable, customer retention strategies (like loyalty programs) should be piloted there. Meanwhile, "Growth" strategies should target under-performing but high-potential regions like Brazil and Canada to close the gap.

3. Inventory Efficiency: The "Pareto Principle" in Sales
Sales follow the "80/20 rule," where a small percentage of high-performing tracks (Hits) generate the majority of the profit. Conversely, a significant portion of the track catalog has zero sales history.
Recommendation: The business should consider discontinuing licensing fees for tracks that haven't sold in over 12 months. Additionally, high-performing tracks should be bundled with lower-performing ones from the same artist to increase average order value.
